I have 43 cousins, 24 uncles and and 2 sisters. Family has always been of the
utmost importance for me and because of that I want to return to Portugal after
the Masters programme at LBS.
I have always been an avid reader. I have been reading a lot about finance. 
However, I have a great interest in politics (namely political science),
astronomy, chemistry and biology. Regarding to music, I enjoy classical music
but also electronic dance music (a new genre)
