When I was 18 I had already failed twice at school. I was playing poker at 
international level and gave up on studies. Considering the lack of academic
knowledge I had it was natural to believe that university was not my future.
However, in my 20th birthday, I set a goal to be accepted at a top business school.
Studying the high school by myself, and later on getting distinguished as the 
best student from Portugal was all a matter of effort and desire. This type of
mentality grant me a spot at London Business School with a merit scholarship
