Travelling has been one of my main "escapees" from the normal life.
I have always desired to go to new countries. By 2020, I had been in +60 countries
and had scheduled travelling to another 10. I have set a goal of travelling
to more than 100 countries by my 30th birthday. I hope I can fullfill that goal
