I have always been a sports person. Since my young age, I have been playing football.
Being a Sporting Lisbon supporter, I have always had the dream of becoming one of its players. Unfortunately, that was not possible. Nowadays, I dream to become Sporting president.
As a kid, I also played table tennis and badminton at national level. In the last few months, I have been playing padel.
